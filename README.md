<p>This allows us to submit shiftlogs at the end of every shift as well as get weekly updates from our manager. This web application is a full stack application. The backend of the website was made using node.js and express.js along with mongoDB as the database. The front end of the website was created with React.js. Connecting the front end to the back end was done using fetch requests to the backend which is connected to mongoDB. This application also has a fully functional authentication system using jwtTokens. You have the ability to have different users based on the site you are at and you can only see your sites shiftlogs when logged in. This application also used all CRUD operations (get, post, put, and delete).</p>
